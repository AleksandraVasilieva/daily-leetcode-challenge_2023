# daily-leetcode-challenge
Commited to daily leetcode practicing this year!!!!



So they say first several weeks are the hardest(?). So far it's true. Literally have not had a single headache for a year till starting the challenge. Still commited though, here's to 2023

P.S. Starting off with easy ones

Fast forward 2 weeks, I like practicing
